In this repository you will find all code necessary to reproduce the figures presented in 'Pyroglutamation of cell surface proteins CD47 and TRP1 by glutaminyl cyclase modulates therapeutic antibody binding' by van der Plas - van Duijn et al., 2025. 

**Data** 					Contains all data on which our approach for estimating K_D has been applied
	**Experimental data** 			Contains a spreadsheet with titration binding data with one sheet combination of cell-line and genotype
	**Artificial data** 			Contains .rds files that can be read in in R as list objects with each file representing a different set of underlying parameters and each list element being generated with independently sampled noise

**Figures**					Figures generated by running the code

**Results**					Contains .rds files that can be read in in R as data frames with each file representing a different set of underlying parameters and each row representing the parameter estimates from one out of ten generated dataset with independently sampled noise

**Scripts**
	**Functions.R**				Contains all the functions necessary to perform the analyses in 'Main_analysis.Rmd' and 'Model_Validation.Rmd'
	**Main_analysis.Rmd**			Performs the main analysis of evaluating the K_D values of WT and QPCTL KO cell lines from experimental data
	**Model_Validation.Rmd**		Creates supporting figures to explain and validate the approach
